Initialize the migrations package for the recipes app.

This file is intentionally left blank.  Django uses the presence of
this package to discover and track database migrations.  Without an
empty __init__.py, attempts to run `manage.py makemigrations` or
`manage.py migrate` may fail because Django cannot find the migrations
module.
