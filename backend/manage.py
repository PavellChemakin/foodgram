"""
Utility script for administrative tasks.

This entry point allows you to interact with the Django management
commands within the ``foodgram`` project. It sets the default
``DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`` environment variable so that Django knows
which settings to use. When executed, it passes any supplied
commandâ€‘line arguments to Django's ``execute_from_command_line``
function.

Running this script with no arguments will display the list of
available commands. To perform database migrations, create a
superuser or run the development server, invoke the appropriate
command:

    ./manage.py migrate
    ./manage.py createsuperuser
    ./manage.py runserver

The project is designed around Django 4.x and uses Python 3.11 or
later. See the README for further details on project structure and
deployment instructions.
